PostGres is a RDBMS (relational database) that uses SQL (structured query language as a programming language). PostGres skills are transferable to SQL and MySQL.

PostGres can be used with Node and Express with JavaScript libraries in the front-end.

ORM's like Sequelize can be used but you can also work directly with the DB.
