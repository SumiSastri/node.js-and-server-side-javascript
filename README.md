#### Project goals

This project focuses on server-side JavaScript with Node.js.

#### Folder structure

Folders are organised in sections based on following documentation, research from blogs and following some tutorials for specific areas that I found difficult to understand. It serves as a place I can go to for quick reference to code snippets.
