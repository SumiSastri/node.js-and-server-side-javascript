## Project goals

This project focuses on server-side JavaScript with Node.js. Certificates of completion from Linked-in Learning focusing on levelling-up server-side skills. It covers the fundamental concepts from Linked-in Learning tutorials.

## Certifications

Folders are organised in sections based on following documentation, research from blogs and following some tutorials for specific areas that I found difficult to understand. It serves as a place I can go to for quick reference to code snippets.
