Fetch is vanilla JavaScript, it is not a third party library and can be read directly by browsers. The downside is you have to manually transform data. It is more verbose and harder to work with. It also needs to be set up for Internet Explorer as it does not work with the browsers' JavaScript engine.

To set up we need to add an additional node package to the front-end of our files.
